    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
    My name is Andrew Hanrahan. I am a masterâ€™s student in the <strong>Information Systems</strong> program and I am in my second semester. I am also enrolled in the Certificate of Advanced Study program in <strong>Cloud Management</strong> and <strong>Designing Digital Instruction</strong>. My undergrad is from the School of Education where I majored in education technology. 
    </p>
    <p>
    My skills related to technology are understanding cloud and security fundamentals, but I really want to build out my technical skills. 
    </p>

   <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <p>
    Outside of technology, my skills are playing piano and singing. I love to read fiction and non-fiction books, drink coffee, and watch YouTube videos. 
    </p>
    <p>
    I am very excited to be in this class because I want to learn how to design web pages to complement my instructional design interests; I want my part-time side gig to be to creating web-based courses for adult learners.
