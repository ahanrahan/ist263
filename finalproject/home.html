Welcome to my project portfolio! A bit about me:
My name is Andrew Hanrahan, and I am a master’s student at Syracuse University studying information systems and cloud management.
My higher education journey started as an undergraduate student at Syracuse University, where I began my program majoring in music education and music history. In my second year of the program, I knew I wanted to complement my music education coursework by taking classes outside the major, but because of the restrictions within the degree and amount of major-specific credits required, I opted to change my majors to education studies (concentration in education technology) and music, giving me ultimate flexibility in my coursework. With this decision, I was excited to take courses in the School of Information Studies (iSchool) on campus, home to the information and technology major, where I ended up falling in love with the coursework. After taking intro to IT, computer networking and cloud, and intro to project management, I knew that I wanted to dive into iSchool beyond my undergraduate degree.
Upon graduating with my bachelor’s degree in August 2023, I immediately began my graduate degree in information systems with a certificate in cloud networking and security management. In my time as a graduate student at Syracuse University, I have taken coursework in cloud management, enterprise architecture, and virtualization. Not being able to stay away from my other academic interests, I have continued to enroll in choir each semester and took a graduate level course on technology in instructional settings. I have also decided to audit undergraduate courses, including intro to front-end website development and agile project management that I was not able to previously fit into my undergraduate course of study.
I strive to work in the fields of education and IT, either in a K-12 setting or higher education setting, managing information technology infrastructure. It is my goal to change the future of technology integration in the classroom through the introduction of cutting-edge technology.
In this portfolio website, you will see examples of the work that I have completed at Syracuse University, both for course projects and for academic research.
