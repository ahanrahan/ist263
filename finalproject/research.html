                    My undergraduate Honors thesis, “Exploring Digital Transformation in Microsoft Showcase Schools” is my flagship research experience. Over the course of two weeks, I sought out to observe five different schools in the United Kingdom with the Microsoft Showcase School designation to define digital transformation in an educational context.

                    The abstract of my paper reads: we are now in the exciting era of digital transformation, a time where we rethink how technology can be incorporated into all areas of business and fundamentally change existing processes. Schools are no exception to this, despite a natural apprehension about technological progress that was pushed onto schools overnight as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, I look to determine the definition, implications, and supports required for digital transformation in an educational setting. Through the exploration of five Microsoft Showcase Schools in the United Kingdom, I conclude that digital transformation is not a destination—but a journey—to maximize student success via individualized learning and that it requires a clear vision and structural support from the administration.

                    There were three methods for this research study: observations, interviews, and surveys. Throughout the two weeks of data collections and in 5 different schools, I observed 25 classes, documented 12 interviews, and had 268 student survey participants and 46 teacher/staff survey participants.

                    Upon the completion of my thesis, my bachelor’s degree was certified, summa cum laude. Since the publication of my thesis, I was proud to have garnered attention from Microsoft executives and was able to present in the Microsoft Education Empowerment (E2) Summit where I presented my research to Microsoft Innovative Educator (MIE) Experts around the world.

                    In the summer of 2021, I served as a research assistant to the Professor Amanda Eubanks Winkler’s project that sought to discover if there was a parallel between 1960s British rock music and the style of the music written in the Baroque era (c. 1600-1750). In this project, it was my role to explore as much existing research about the topic as possible and compile an annotated bibliography that would be submitted weekly to the primary researcher, Prof. Winkler. This project was my first foray into academic research and gave me a solid foundation of the research process for my future endeavors.

                    My second selected research assignment was for an undergraduate Honors course titled American Freedom before and after Emancipation, which focused on the idea of freedom during the era of Black slavery, questioning how emancipation affected conceptions and experiences of freedom among free people of color before and after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued. For my final research project, titled “The Spirit of Education regarding Freed People in the Wake of American Emancipation,” I was guided by the following question: what was the spirit of education in the wake of emancipation regarding educating a large population of newly freed people whose education ability ranged from illiteracy to higher education?         </p>
                <p>
                    The primary drivers of this research were documents I encountered in Syracuse University’s Special Collections Research Centers, where I read primary documents of letters written in 1868 as part of the collection of letters of Gerrit Smith. In viewing a transactional document that demonstrated the gift of $1,000 to Howard University for the purposes of “funding indigent students’ education,” I was eager to learn what it meant to seek education before and after emancipation. I also came across a series of documents, 6 volumes of a weekly newsletter, The Freedman, that was supposed to be used to give introductory arithmetic and literature lessons to recently-freed Black people. I explored a course catalogue from Howard University from the year 1869-70 where I was able to see which courses were offered. This research enabled me to seek the answer to my question, to define the spirit of education.

                    The deliverable of this project was a comprehensive research paper and a presentation given to my classmates, professor, and special guest, the Dean of the Syracuse University Libraries.
